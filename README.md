<p><strong>Raspberry Pi Personal Assistant Web Server/Controller:</strong></p>
<p>This is the web application that was used to control the <a href="https://github.com/markytools/google-raspi3-assistant">Raspberry Pi Personal Assistant</a>, using the Django framework to create the backend application. In this case, I named the Django app &ldquo;typiremote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raspberry Pi requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Django 1.10.5 &gt;=</li>
<li>MySQL / MariaDB</li>
<li>Apache Web Server</li>
</ul>

<p>The controller contains various settings for setting up the Voice Assistant. One is Linphone SIP accounts so that you can make Voice Calls with the Assistant. Another one is to upload the music files so that you can command the Assistant to play those audio files.</p>
